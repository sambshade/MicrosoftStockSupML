# DTSA 5509 - Supervised Machine Learning - Final Project: Microsoft Stock Prices From 2000 - 2023.

The following dataset is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwaldongre/microsoft-stock-price2000-2023/data) and represents the Microsoft Stock Price form 2000 - 2023. The data is split into the following columns (copied directly from Kaggle):

* Date: This column represents the calendar date when the data about the stock is recorded.

* Open: This column represents the first recorded price of the stock for a trading session.

* High: The high price represents the highest traded price of the stock during a given trading session. It reflects the peak value that the stock reached during the day.

* Low: The low price is the lowest traded price of the stock during a specific trading session. It indicates the minimum value that the stock reached during the day.

* Close: The closing price is the last traded price of the stock at the end of a trading session. It reflects the final value at which the stock was traded before the market closes.

* Adj Close(Adjusted Close): The adjusted closing price accounts for corporate actions, such as dividends, stock splits, and new stock offerings, that may affect the stock's price but are not directly related to its performance. The adjusted close is often used to assess the stock's performance over time.

* Volume: Volume represents the total number of shares traded during a specific time period. It gives an indication of the level of market activity and liquidity for that stock. High volume often suggests increased investor interest, while low volume may indicate less active trading.

This project is to examine how Supervised Machine Learning Models can help predict beneficial information to an investor in Microsoft Stock by examining how to predict closing prices and positive/negative returns.
